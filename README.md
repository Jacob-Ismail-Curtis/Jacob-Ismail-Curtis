## About Me
Hi, I'm Jacob, a programmer from the South West of England. I have recently graduated from Durham University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Durham University!

During my time as an undergraduate, I have found a passion for machine learning and blank. I am also very interested in financial markets and am looking to find opportunities to further explore these two fields and combine them.

I am in the process of applying for graduate roles, looking particularly for roles in software development and machine learning, ideally within the FinTech industries.
